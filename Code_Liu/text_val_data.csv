Findings observed in retrospect on the previous study, however, are very subtle. The elderly patient has an accentuated kyphotic curvature in the thoracic spine, moderately demineralized vertebral bodies, but no evidence of any vertebral body compression fracture. Within the normal heart shadow, one can identify a few coronary arterial calcifications within the heart shadow which, however, is not surprising considering patient's advanced age. Borderline heart size and generally widened thoracic aorta. Absence of significant pulmonary vascular congestion. No evidence of acute infiltrates, no radiopaque foreign body identified. Absence of any detectable pulmonary atelectasis or pneumothorax are encouraging findings considering patient's history.
