Appearance of thoracic aorta is unchanged demonstrating a few calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch. No new contour abnormalities identified. Now evidence of bilateral pleural effusions blunting the lateral pleural sinuses and obscuring the outer thirds of the diaphragmatic contours. Although this results in a crowded appearance of the basal pulmonary vessels, exist also suspicious small patchy parenchymal densities, which clearly seen on the right base, which deserve further evaluation. On the lateral view, a mild blunting of the posterior pleural sinuses is seen and again the crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature makes precise evaluation of suspected small patchy densities difficult. In comparison with the previous chest examination obtained two days earlier whether findings were practically within normal limits present examination identifies the occurrence of new small amounts of bilateral pleural effusions. As the heart contours also have undergone a change in appearance with broader diameter on the bases, possibility of coinciding pericardial effusion should be considered. Comparison of the pulmonary vasculature does not indicate significant pulmonary vascular venous congestion, there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. Rather sudden onset of bilateral pleural effusions and change of cardiac contours suspicious for coinciding development of pericardial effusion.
